# Planning

An implementation of planning algorithms in Clojure.

Currently provided algorithms are:

 * [Breadth first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
 * [Depth first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
 * [Greedy breadth first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-first_search)
 * [Dijksta's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
 * [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)

All algorithms are specified by an input map of the form:
```clojure
{:start        start-state ;Required for all
 :goal         goal-state ;Required for search functions (where a path is provided)
 :neighbors-fn neighbors-fn ;Required for all. Takes a state and returns a sequence of neighboring states immediately reachable by the provided state.
 :heuristic-fn heuristic-fn ;Required for greedy BFS & A*. Takes two states and returns the estimated numeric cost of going from one to the other.
 :cost-fn      cost-fn ;Required for Dijkstra & A*. Takes two states and returns the actual numeric cost of going from one to the other.
}
```

Three families of functions are provided for each algorithm:
 * seq functions (e.g. `A-star-seq`) that return a lazy seq of solution steps. Will terminate for finite search spaces when all nodes have been visited. No `:goal` is required for seq functions.
 * terminus functions (e.g. `A-star-terminus`) that provide the complete final state of the algorithm when the goal is found.
 * search functions (e.g. `A-star-search`) that return the solved path from start to goal (or nil if none).

## Examples
The test directory is a great place to find examples of how to use these algorithms.

Using the planning algorithms is quite simple.
```clojure
;;Pull in the core dependency
(require '[planning.core :as p])

;;Compute the steps required to go from 200 to 17 by only doubling, adding 2, or halving the input (if even) at each step.
;;Note that the neighbors function is an unbounded search space (e.g. as opposed to a simple grid).
(p/breadth-first-search
 {:start        200
  :goal         17
  :neighbors-fn (fn [x] (cond-> [(* 2 x) (+ 2 x)] (even? x) (conj (/ x 2))))})
```
